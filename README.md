# Tic Tac Toe Game in Java

This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java, providing an interactive console-based interface where two players can compete. Designed with simplicity and efficiency, the game logic handles all win/lose conditions, checks for valid moves, and detects a tie when all board spaces are occupied. 

## Features
- **Two-player gameplay** with a clear display of moves
- **Game board and player input validation** to prevent invalid moves
- **Win, Lose, and Tie detection** for a fair play experience
- **Modular and well-documented code** for easy understanding and modification

## Getting Started
Clone this repository, compile, and run the game directly in your Java environment to start playing!
